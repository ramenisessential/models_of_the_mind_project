# models_of_the_mind_project
a set of algorithms discussed in the book "models of the mind" by grace lindsay.
I will be demonstrating what I have learned from the book and applying it to machine-learning models that I will briefly explain

why c++
these are exaamples of code that need to be readable and easily understandable, python is easier to write,
but it abstracts a lot of things that c++ does not, which is not desirable to demonstrate these algorithms clearly.
